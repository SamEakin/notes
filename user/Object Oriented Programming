#Class Notes

##Testing
• Black box testing - can only test inputs and outputs. No looking inside the code. Have no knowledge of how it is built. Very limited. 
• White box testing - “path testing” looking into the code and testing all possible paths of execution.

• < input
• > output

_to run: sh <  testScript
{{{echo "test main program branch 1 -- error: missing file"
java RoadNetwork

echo "test main program branch 2 -- error: too many params"
java RoadNetwork x y

echo "test main program branch 4 -- error: can't open input file"
java RoadNetwork asdfsdfasfas

echo "test main program branch 3 -- regular case"
java RoadNetwork Roads
}}}

_to run expanded: sh < testScript > testOutput_
   ◦ executes inputs in testScript and puts output in file testOutput
