#Chapter 1: Logic

Propositions:
   • *Logic*: The study of formal reasoning. 
   • *Proposition*: A statement that is either T or F.
       *Compound Proposition*: Connecting individual propositions with logical operations.
Logical Operations: 
   *Conjunction*: (^  = AND)
        P: 2 is even.
        Q: 3 is odd.
        P ^ Q = 2 is even and 3 is odd.
        P ^ Q = TRUE.
        
        Truth Table
        P  Q  P^Q
        T  T  T   P^Q is true when both P and Q are true
        T  F  F
        F  T  F   false when either P or Q are false
        F  F  F
   *Disjunction*: (v = OR)
        P: 2 is even.
        Q: 3 is odd.
        P v Q = 2 is even or 3 is odd.
        P v Q = TRUE.

        Truth Table
        P  Q  PvQ
        T  T  T
        T  F  T   PvQ is true when either P or Q is true.
        F  T  F
        F  F  F 
      P  -P
      T  F
      F  T
Order of Operations: 
   1) - (not)
   2) ^ (and)
   3) v (or)

      P: true 
      Q: false
      R: true
         
      P ^ -(Q v R)
      T ^ -(F v T)
      T ^ -T
      T ^ F
      _F_

Filling in rows of a truth table:
   If there are n variables, there are 2^n rows. 
Conditional Operation: (→ = THEN):
   P -> Q is read as “if P then Q.”
   P: hypothesis
   Q: conclusion

   P only if Q == if P then Q
   _P → Q == ~P v Q_

   Truth Table
   P  Q  P→Q
   T  T  T
   T  F  F   “false if P is true and Q is false, otherwise always true.”
   F  T  T
   F  F  T

Biconditional Operation: (<-> = IF AND ONLY IF)
   → if 1 is true then the other is true.
   → if 1 is false then the other is false.

   _P <-> Q = (P→Q) ^ (Q→P)_

Logical Equivalence:
   • A compound proposition is a *Tautology* if the proposition is always true.
   • A compound proposition is a *Contradiction* if the proposition is always false.

      Truth table for Tautology
         P  ~P  (P v ~P)
         T   F   T
         F   T   T

      Truth table for Contradiction
         P  ~P  (P ^ ~P)
         T   F   F
         F   T   F
   • Two propositions are said to be *logically equivalent* if they have the same truth values of their individual propositions.
      P == R “P is logically equivalent to R.” 
         → this is true only if P <—> R is a *tautology*.
         
         Show that P → ~P == ~P :
            P  ~P  (P → ~P)
            T   F   F
            F   T   T    ~P and (P → ~P) both have the same truth values so they are logically equivalent.

De Morgan’s Laws:
   How to distribute a negation(~) inside a parenthesized expression.

      1) ~ (P v Q) == (~P ^ ~Q)
      2) ~ (P ^ Q) == (~P v ~Q)
      
Laws of Propositional Logic:
   If two propositions are logically equivalent, then one can be substituted for the other within a more complex proposition.

      For example;
        P → Q == ~P v Q    therefore;
        (P v R) ^ (~P v Q) == (P v R) ^ (P → Q)

   Laws:
      •Idempotent Law:
         P v P == P
         P ^ P == P

      • Associative Law:
         (P v Q) v R == P v (Q v R)
         (P ^ Q) ^ R == P ^ (Q ^ R)
         
      • Commutative Law:
         P v Q == Q v P
         P ^ Q == Q ^ P

      • Distributive Law:
         P v (Q ^ R) == (P v Q) ^ (P v R)
         P ^ (Q v R) == (P ^ Q) v (P ^ R)

      • Identity Law:
         P v F == P
         P ^ T == P

      • Domination Law:
         P ^ F == F
         P v T == T

      • Double Negation Law:
         P == ~ ~P

      • Complement Law:
         P ^ ~P == F
         ~T == F
         P v ~P == T
         ~F == T

      • De Morgan’s Law:
         ~ (P v Q) == ~P ^ ~Q 
         ~ (P ^ Q) == ~P v ~Q 

      • Absorption Law:
          P v (P ^ Q) == P
          P ^ (P v Q) == P

      • Conditional Identities:
         P → Q == ~P v Q
         P <-> Q == (P → Q) ^ (Q → P)

Predicates and Quantifiers:
   • A  *Predicate* is a logical statement whose truth value is a function of one or more variables.

      x is an odd number.
         > This is not a proposition because truth value depends on value of x.
         > Truth value of statement can be expressed as a function.
      P(5) = 5 is an odd number = true

     • A *Domain* of a variable in a predicate is set of all possible values for that variable.

Universal Quantifier:
   Vx P(x)
      > P(x) is true for all possible x values in its domain.
      > If true, then it is a *universally quantified statement*.
   x = {a,b,c}
   Vx P(x) == P(a) ^ P(b) ^ P(c)

   For example; 
      Prove [ Vx (1/(x+1)) < 1 ] is true for any positive real number x.

      0 < x  “true for all positive integers x.”
      0+1 < x+1  “add 1 to both sides.”
      1 < x + 1
      1/(x+1) < (x+1)/ (x+1)  “divide both sides by (x+1).”
      Vx[1/(x+1) < 1] “true for all positive integers x.”

   •*Counterexample*: an element in the domain of Vx P(x) that is false.

Existential Quantifier: 
   Ex P(x) “There exists an x, such that P(x).”
      > Asserts that P(x) is true for at least 1 possible value for x in its domain.
      
   x = {a,b,c}
   Ex P(x) == P(a) v P(b) v P(c)
 
Quantified Statements:
   Ex ( P(x) ^ Q(x) )  “There is an x for P and Q to be true.”
   • Counterexample to prove Vx.
   • Example to prove Ex.
   De Morgan’s Law for Quantified Statements:
      1) -Vx F(x) == Ex -F(x)
      2) -Ex P(x) == Vx -P(x)

      Example;
         ~ Ex (P(x) → ~ Q(x))
         Vx ~ (P(x) → ~ Q(x)) “De Morgan’s law”
         Vx ~ (~ P(x) → ~ Q(x)) “Conditional property”
         Vx (~~ P(x) ^ ~~ Q(x)) “De Morgan’s law”
         Vx (P(x) ^ Q(x)) “Double negation law”

Nested Quantifiers:
   • If a predicate has more than one variable, each variable must be bound by a separate quantifier.

   VxEy P(x,y) “x and y are both bound.”
   Vx P(x,y) “x is bound, y is free.”

   De Morgan’s Law for Quantified Statements:
         1) ~ Vx Vy P(x,y) == Ex Ey ~ P(x,y)
         2) ~ Vx Ey P(x,y) == Ex Vy ~ P(x,y)
         3) ~ Ex Vy P(x,y) == Vx Ey ~ P(x,y)
         4) ~ Ex Ey P(x,y) == Vx Vy ~ P(x,y)

         @TODO: 1.10 Nested Quantified Statements review more..
Logical Reasoning:
   • *Argument*: A series of propositions (called *hypotheses*)
   • Followed by a final proposition, called the *Conclusion*.
   • Argument is valid IF the conclusion is true whenever all hypotheses are true.

#Chapter 2: Proofs
   • A *Theorem* is a statement that can be proven to be true. 
   • A *Proof* consists of several steps which has a final step showing a theorem to be true.
   • The proof of a theorem may use *Axioms*(statements already proven to be true).

   Example;
      Theorem : Every positive integer is less than or equal to its square.
      Proof : 
         1) Let x be an integer x > 0
         2) Since x is an integer and x > 0: 
               x >= 1
         3) Since x > 0, we can multiply both sides by x:
               x(x) >= 1(x)
         4) Simplify: 
               x^2 >= x  TRUE

Proofs by Exhaustion: 
   • If the domain of a universal statement is small, it is easiest to prove the statement by checking each element individually.
      ◦ For example: If n E {-1,0,1}, then n^2 = |n|
      ◦ Proof:
         ▸ n = -1: (-1)^2 = 1 = |-1| “true”
         ▸ n = 0: (0)^2 = 0 = |0| “true”
         ▸ n = 1: (1)^2 = 1 = |1| “true”
            ▹ Statement is true
Counterexamples:
   • If the domain is really big then you can disprove a theorem by finding one case where it is *false*.

Direct Proofs:
   • _Assume: HYPOTHESIS_
   • _Derive: CONCLUSION_
   • Many theorems take the form of a conditional statement in which a conclusion follows from a set of hypotheses.
      ◦ Theorems of this kind take the form *p → c*
         ▸ *p* is a proposition that is a conjunction of all the hypotheses.
         ▸ *c* is the conclusion.
   • In a direct proof of a conditional statement, the hypothesis *p* is assumed *true* and the conclusion *c* is proven as a result of the assumption.
   • For Example:
      ◦ For every integer n, if n is odd, then n^2 is odd.
      ◦ Let D(n) mean n is odd.
      ◦ Vn (D(n) → D(n^2))

   A *RATIONAL NUMBER* is a number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

   • For Example: 
      ◦ If R and S are rational numbers, Then R + S is also rational.
      ◦ R = a/b
      ◦ S = c/d
      ◦ R + S = (ad + cb) / bd
      ◦ Since b != 0 and d != 0, then bd != 0
         ▸ R + S must be a ratio of integers.. So it’s rational.

   • For Example:
      ◦ If: x & y are real and x > 0 & y > 0
      ◦ Then: (x/y) + (y/x) >= 2
      ◦ xy[ (x/y) + (y/x) ] >= xy[ 2 ]
      ◦ x^2 + y^2 >= 2xy
      ◦ x^2 -2xy + y^2
      ◦ (x - y)^2 >= 0
         ▸ since x & y are R+ then this is always true.

Proof by Contrapositive:
   • _Assume: ~CONCLUSION
   • _Show: ~HYPOTHESIS_
   • Proves a conditional theorem of the form *p → c* by showing that the contrapositive ~c → ~p is *true*.
      ◦ For Example:
      ◦ For every integer n, if n^2 is odd; then n is odd.
      ◦ Vn ( D(n^2) → D(n) )
      ◦ Proving by contrapositive: assume that D(n) is false and therefore D(n^2) is also false.
      ◦ 2n: even
      ◦ 2n^2 = 2(n * n): even * even = even

Deciding to Prove directly or by contrapositive:
   • Does the hypothesis or the negation of the conclusion provide a more useful assumption to work with?
   • For Example:
      ◦ For every x is a positive int, If x^2 is even.
      ◦ Then x is even.
      ◦ By contrapositive:
      ◦ 2k + 1 odd
      ◦ (2k + 1)^2
      ◦ 4k^2 + 4k + 1
      ◦ 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1   “(2k^2 + 2k) is an integer k’”
      ◦ 2k’ + 1   “odd”

Proof by Contradiction:
   • _Assume: ~THEOREM_
   • _Show: INCONSISTENCY_
   • Start by assuming that the entire theorem is *false* and then shows that some logical inconsistency arises as a result.
      ◦ If T is the theorem statement, the proof begins with the assumption ~T.
      ◦ This leads to a conclusion R ^ ~R , for some proposition R.
   • If P → Q
      ◦ Then the assumption is P ^ ~Q  “which is logically equivalent to ~(P→Q)
   • Unlike direct and contrapositive proofs; these can be used to prove theorems that are not in conditional statements.
   • Sometimes called an *INDIRECT PROOF*.

Summary of Proof Types:
   • Assume theorem is given in the form *P → Q*
      1) *Direct Proof:* Assume *P*. 
         ▸ Follow a series of steps to conclude *Q*.
      2) *Contrapositive:* Assume ~ *Q*. 
         ▸ Follow a series of steps to conclude ~ *P*.
      3) *Contradiction:* Assume *P ^ ~Q*. 
         ▸ Follow a series of steps to conclude *R ^ ~R*.

Proof by Cases:
   • Many theorems can be expressed as Vx P(x). Where P is a predicate with variable x whose value can be an element from some domain.
   • Someteimes proving for all the elements in a set simultaneously is difficult. Instead, we can split it up.
   • *Proof by cases* splits up Vx p(x) into separate classes and gives a separate proof for each.
   • For Example:
      ◦ For every integer x ; x^2 - x is an even integer.
      ◦ Case 1: x is even
         ▸ x = 2k for some integer k
         ▸ x^2 - x = (2k)^2 - 2k
         ▸ 4k^2 - 2k == 2(2k^2 - k)
         ▸ 2(k’) “even”
      ◦ Case 2: x is odd
         ▸ x = 2k + 1 for some integer k
         ▸ (2k + 1)^2 - (2k + 1)
         ▸ 4k^2 + 4k - 2k
         ▸ 4k^2 + 2k
         ▸ 2(2k^2 + k) “even”
   
#Chapter 3: Sets
   • A *set* is a collection of objects.
   • Objects in a set are called *elements*.
   • The symbol ∈ (E for these notes) indicates what is in a set.
      ◦ 2 E A “2 is an element in set A.”
   • *Cardinality* is the size of a set. Denoted as *|A|*.

Common Set Notation:
   • *N*: The set of natural numbers. “0, 1, 2, ...”
   • *Z*: The set of all integers. “... -2, -1, 0, 1, ...”
   • *Q*: The set of all rational numbers. “0, 1/2, etc”
   • *R*: The set of all real numbers. “0, 1/2, 5.23, pi, sqrt(2), ...”

   • _0 is neither positive or negative!_

Set Notation: 
   • Defining a set by specifying that it includes all elements in a larger set that also satisfy the given conditions.
      ◦ Looks like this: *A = {x E S: P(x)}*
         ▸ *S* is the larger set from which the elements in A are taken.
         ▸ *P(x)* is some condition for membership in set *A*.
         ▸ the *:* symbol is read as “such that”.

Universal Set:
   • Denoted as *U*, is the set that contains all elements in a particular context.

Subsets:
   • If every element in *A* is also an element of *B*:
      ◦ Then *A* is a subset of *B*. 
      ◦ Denoted as: *A ⊆ B*  “A c B for these notes.”
   • *A = B* only if (A c= B) & (B c= A)
   • For Example:
      ◦ A = {1,2,3}
      ◦ B = {1,2,3,4}
         ▸ A c= B
         ▸ B !c= A “because B doesn’t contain the same elements as A.”
   • If A c= B *but* B has an element that is not in A, then A is a *PROPER SUBSET* of B.
      ◦ from above example: A is a proper subset of B

Sets of Sets:
   • The elements of a set can be sets themselves.
      ◦ A = {{1,2}, {4}, {1,2,3}}
         ▸ {1,2} E A
         ▸ 1 !E A

Power Sets: 
   • Denoted *P(A)*:
      ◦ Is the subset of all subsets of *A*.
         ▸ A = {1,2,3}
         ▸ P(A) = {{null},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}
   _THEOREM_
   Cardinality of a Power Set:
      • Let A be a finite set of cardinality n.
      • The cardinality of the power set of A is 2^n. → or |P(A)| = 2^n
Set Operations:
   Intersection Operation on Sets:
      • A ^ B is all elements that are in both set A and set B.
         ◦ A = {1,2,3} B = {2,3,4}
         ◦ A ^ B = {2,3}
      • Can also apply to infinite sets.
         ◦ A = { x E Z: x is an integer of multiple 2.
         ◦ B = { x E Z: x is an integer of multiple 3.
         ◦ A ^ B = { x E Z: x is an integer of multiple 6.
            ▸ A ^ B is the set of all integers that are a multiple of both 2 and 3.
   Union of Sets:
      • A u B is the set of all elements that are in either A or B.
         ◦ A = {1,2} B = {3}
         ◦ A u B = {1,2,3}
   Set Difference:
      • *A - B* is the difference between A and B. 
      • The Set of elements that are in A but not B.
         ▸ A = {1,2,3} B = {2,3,4}
         ▸ A - B = {1}
      • *A - B != B - A* “not commutative”
      Symmetric Difference:
         • A ⊕ B is the set of elements that are in either A or B *BUT NOT BOTH!*
         • A ⊕ B = (A - B) u (B - A)
   Set Complement:
      • ‘A is the complement of A
      • The set of all elements that are in U but not in A.
Set Identities:
   1) x ∈ A ∩ B   ↔   (x ∈ A) ∧ (x ∈ B)
   2) x ∈ A ∪ B   ↔   (x ∈ A) ∨ (x ∈ B)
   3) x ∈ A’   ↔      ¬(x ∈ A)

   4) x ∈ ∅   ↔   F
   5) x ∈ U   ↔   T

   • A *set identity* is an equation involving sets that is true regardless of the contents of the sets in the expression.
Cartesian Products:
   • An *ordered pair* of items is written (x,y).
   • The order matters! Indicated by ()
      ◦ (x,y) != (y,x) “unless x = y”
      ◦ {x,y} == {y,x}
   • For two sets A and B:
      ◦ The cartesian product is *A x B*
         ▸ A x B is the set of all ordered pairs in which the first entry is in A and the second entry is in B.

    A x B = { (a, b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B }

   • For Example:
      ◦ A = {1,2} B = {a,b}
      ◦ A x B = {(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b)}
Partitions:
   • *A* and *B* are *disjoint* if their intersection is empty.
      ◦ A ^ B = NULL
   • A sequence of sets is *pairwise disjoint* if every pair of distinct sets in the sequence is disjoint.
      ◦ Ai ^ Aj = NULL for any i and j in range 1 → n where i != j
   • For Example:
      ◦ A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
      ◦ A1 = {1,2,3}
      ◦ A2 = {4}
      ◦ A3 = {5,6}
         ▸ A1 A2 A3 are partitions of A.

#Chapter 4: Functions

   • A *function* maps elements from one set A to another set B.
   • f:A → B “f is a function from A to B.”
      ◦ A is the *domain* of f.
      ◦ B is the *target* of f.
   • Also denoted as *f(x) = y*.
   • For function *f:X → Y*
      ◦ an element *y* is in the *RANGE* of *f* if and only if there is an *(x E X)* such that *(x,y) E f*.
      ◦ Range of f = { y: (x, y) ∈ f, for some x ∈ X }
   • The *range* of a function is a subset of the target but isn’t necessarily == to the target.
      ◦ In an *Arrow Diagram*, the range is the set of elements with arrows pointing to them.
Floor and Ceiling functions:
   • Mapping real numbers (*R*) into integers(*Z*).
   • *Floor*: round down.
   • *Ceiling*: round up.

#Chapter 7: Sequences
   • A *sequence* is a special type of function in which the domain is a consecutive set of integers.
      ◦ For example:
      ◦ G(x) is a function for the GPA of a student throughout 4 years.
      ◦ The domain is {1,2,3,4} “sequential → sequence”
      ◦ {G(1) = 4.0 ,G(2) = 3.5, G(3) = 2.0, G(4) = 3.0}
      ◦ *Indexes:* 1,2,3,4 
         ▸ 1 is *initial index*.
         ▸ 4 is *final index*.
      ◦ *Terms:* 4.0, 3.5, 2.0, 3.0
Geometric sequence: 
   • A sequence of real numbers where each term after the original is found by multiplying by the *common ratio*.
      ◦ For example: 
         ▸ Initial term = 4, Common ratio = 1/2
         ▸ {4,2,1,1/2}
   • Given initial term and ratio: find term x.
      ◦ S(x) = S(0)(ratio^x)
Arithmetic Sequence:
   • A sequence of real numbers where each term after the first has a *common difference*.
      ◦ For example:
      ◦ S(0) = 1, common diff = 2
      ◦ {1,3,5,7,9}
      ◦

#Chapter 8-9: Counting

• N = number of items
• K = kinds of said items

QUICKNOTES:

Let A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
• Pick 3
• How Many:
   1) Ordered sequences: _Permutations_
      ◦ Without repitition?
         ▸ P(6,3) = 6 * 5 * 4 ==  6! / 3!
      ◦ With repitition?
         ▸ 6 * 6 * 6 == 6³
   2) Unordered: _Combinations_
      ◦ Without repitition?
         ▸ 6! / 3!(6-3)!
      ◦ With repitition? “n choose r”
         ▸ (6-3+1)! / 3!

Sequences:
   ◦ “permutation with repitition”
   ◦ Ordered
   ◦ Repeating
   ◦ take N, stack them

• K ^ N

Arrangements:
   ◦ “permutation without replacement”
   ◦ Ordered

#Chapter 11: Graphs

Parallel Edges: - multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. 

Self-Loop: - an edge between a vertex and itself.

Simple Graph:  does not have any parallel edges or self-loops.

Regular Graph:  all vertices have the same degree.

D-Regular Graph: - all vertices have degree = D.

Komplete Graph:  *K*n has an edge between every pair of n vertices. Called a _Clique_ of size n. Or an n-clique.
   ◦ for K₄ → m = (⁴₂)

Isomorphic Graph:  graphs with the same properties as one-another. 

Bi-Partite Graph: a graph where you can split the vertices down the middle and each edge will connect from one side to the other.

Complete BiPartite: Graph - *K*x,y a bi-partite graph where *x* vertices on the left are each connected to all *y* vertices on the right & vice-versa

Planar Graph:  can be drawn in the plane without any edge crossings.
   ◦ Determining if a graph is planar...
   ◦ “Euler’s Identity”:
      ▸ n - m + r = 2
         ▹ n = nodes
         ▹ m = edges
         ▹ r = regions
   ◦ Finding number of edges in a planar graph...i
      ▸ m ≤ 3n - 6 
         ▹ this will prove if a K graph is planar or not!

Incremental Construction of graph G:
   1. only an edge is added. → m++
   2. an edge and vertex are added. → n++ m++ 
      ◦ therefore, if G has n nodes, Gs → (n-1) step 2’s.
   • *Proof*:
      ◦ r = 1+(m−(n−1)) = 2+m−n

Regions: 
   • Degree of a region = ∑m around the region
      ▸ Trace the edges. Internal edges are counted twice (you trace each side)

Coloring:
   • Used to represent constraints on a graph.

   • Chromatic Number X(G): minimum # of colors needed.
      ◦ “Lower Bound of X(G)”
      ◦ maximum clique = ω (G) 
      ◦ if G is undirected
         ▸ ω (G) ≤ X(G)
      ◦ “Upper Bound of X(G)”
      ◦ maximum degree of any vertex in G = ∆(G)
         ▸ X(G) ≤ ∆(G) + 1

       ω (G) ≤ X(G) ≤ ∆(G) + 1


   • “Greedy Coloring Algorithm”
      1) Number set of possible colors. (more than you’ll probably need)
      2) Order vertices in any arbitrary order. 
      3) for each *v*
         ▸ assign a color different than it’s neighbors.
         ▸ for each selection use the lowest color# possible.

#Chapter 12: Trees

   • An undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

   • *P*n is a graph

#Chapter 13: Integer Properties

Division Theorem:
   ◦ For any two numbers A and D:
      ◦ _A = DQ + R_
         ▸ Q = quotient
         ▸ R = remainder

   ◦ Therefore if:
      ◦ A = DQ
   ◦ Then:
      ◦ D | A

Greatest Common Divisor:
• The largest number that divides both X and Y.

• GCD(X,Y)

• “Bezout’s Identity”
   ◦ If:
      GCD(A,B) = G
   ◦ Then:
      AX + BY = G

• To find A and B coefficients use “Euclid’s Algorithm”.

Euclid’s Algorithm:
• For A, B, and X: 
   ◦ GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A-BX)
      ◦ recurse until B == 0


• Modular Version:
   ◦ GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A % B)
      ◦ recurse until B == 0
   ◦ This version is good because we don’t have to pick an X coefficient!

Modular Arithmetic:
• A is congruent-mod M to B if:
   ◦ A % M == B % M 

Discrete Logarithm:

_Regular Modulus:
x mod p

   ◦ 46 mod 12: “12 goes into 46 N times and has remainder R”
   ◦ 46 mod 12 = 10: “46 mod 12 is CONGRUENT to 10” 

_Discrete Modulus_
x mod p

1) find a prime *p*
2) find *x* such that it is a primitive root of *p*   

   ◦   mod 17
   ◦ 3 mod 17
   ◦ for 3², 3³, 3⁴, 3⁵, ...
   ◦ 3^x mod 17 == equally likely to be any number between 1 and *p-1*
      ◦ 3¹ mod 17 = 3 mod 17   = 2
      ◦ 3² mod 17 = 9 mod 17   = 8
      ◦ 3³ mod 17 = 27 mod 17  = 17
      ◦ 3⁴ mod 17 = 81 mod 17  = 13
      ◦ 3⁵ mod 17 = 243 mod 17 = 5
      ◦ 3⁶ mod 17 = 729 mod 17 = 15
      ◦ 3⁷ mod 17 = 2187 mod 17 = 11

• Given X, 
   ◦ This is easy to solve for N from: 3^X mod 17 = N
• Given N,
   ◦ REALLY hard to solve for X from:  N = 3^x mod 17  






Converting from Decimal to Binary:
1) Convert a number into a sum of powers of 2.

   _Powers of 2_
   2⁰ = 1
   2¹ = 2
   2² = 4
   2³ = 8
   2⁴ = 16
   2⁵ = 32
   2⁶ = 64
   2⁷ = 128
   2⁸ = 256
   2⁹ = 512

2) Starting with the lowest power( 2⁰ = 1 )
   ◦ If sum contains it: 1
   ◦ If not: 0

-Example-
   7
   7=4+2+1
   _ _ _ _
   8 4 2 1

 = 0 1 1 1

Exponentiation by Squaring:
• Allows for fast exponentiation of huuuge numbers.

   _STEPS_
   1) product = 1

   2) for each bit in binary number:
      ◦ if 1 → product = product² * base  
      ◦ if 0 → product = product²

• Example:

   7^9

   9 in base 2’s: 8+0+0+1
   9 in binary:   1 0 0 1
   Base = 7
   P = 1

   1: 1² * 7    = 7
   0: 7²        = 49
   0: 49²       = 2401
   1: 2401² * 7 = 40353607

• Another Example:

   7^103 mod 53

   ◦ Same steps except mod 53 for each calculation.

RSA: 
• Cryptography
   ◦ Public Key
   ◦ Private Key

_Steps_
   1) Pick two large prime numbers P and Q.

   2) Let N = PQ

   3) Compute “Euler’s Totient” ф(N)
      ◦ ф(N) = (P-1)(Q-1)

   4) Find D such that GCD(D,ф(N)) == 1

   5) “Extended Euclidean Algorithm”
      ◦ Find E such that:
      ◦ DE + ф(N)F == 1
         ▸ D → part of private key.
         ▸ E → part of public key.
         ▸ throw away F.
   
   6) Distribute GCD(E,N) as *public key*.

   7) Keep GCD(D,N) as *private key*.

_Implementation_
   1) Sending message M:
      ◦ Convert to number C
         ▸ C = M^E mod  N

   2) Receiving number C:
      ◦ Convert to message M:
         ▸ M = C^D mod N
